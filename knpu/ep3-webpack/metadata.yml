title:  JavaScript for PHP Geeks: Webpack for Module Loading Awesomeness

summary: |
    In JavaScript, if you're still manually including each JavaScript file you depend
    on with a `<script>` tag... there's a better way! ES6 introduced the concept
    of *modules*: the ability (finally!) to isolate our JavaScript into small components
    that live in different files (like we do with classes in JavaScript).
    
    But, to get this to work on the web, we need some help. We need something that's
    able to *read* our imports and aggregate everything we need into a single JavaScript
    file. We need webpack:

    * Using npm... and then yarn for package management
    * Webpack setup: package all modules into a single file
    * Calling Babel from webpack via a loader
    * Webpack dev tools for fast development
    * Webpack Hot Reloading!?
    * Handling multiple files ("entry points")
    * Using Uglify and prepping for production
    * Cache-busting with hashed filenames
    * CommonsChunkPlugin: package common modules together
    * Loading & Packaging CSS/SCSS & images form JavaScript!?

    And most importantly: become empowered to (finally) write organized JavaScript!
