summary: |
    Guess what? JavaScript has evolved, in a *big* way. Did you know a new major
    version of JavaScript was released... in 2015!? Yep, and it's packed with *so*
    many new features and syntaxes, when you see code written in "new" JavaScript,
    it can be barely recognizable at first. But these new features are taking over
    the web. Let's embrace them!

    * Babel! Because you need to *compile* new JavaScript
    * ES6/ECMAScript2015/Harmony: Good things have many names
    * var versus let
    * New Object-Oriented Classes!!?
    * The mysterious (amazing) new "arrow" callback syntax
    * The ...spread Operator
    * Object.assign
    * var, let and const
    * Object literal shorthand
    * Computed Property Names
    * Default function argument values
